## [Unreleased]

## TBD

### Added

- Configurable surface tint: the `tint` option in `blade-components.php` renders `--tint*` custom properties and a `.bc-surface` utility into the `@ddfsnStyles` stylesheet, mixing a single colour into the theme background across solid component surfaces, with an optional hard-edged heading band for the classic "card with header" two-tone. `window.DDFSN.setTint()` overrides it per browser (persisted in localStorage, restored pre-paint).
- Inverted stacking hierarchy: `.bc-surface` now tints the theme's lifted `--muted` base instead of `--background`, so dark themes show a dark canvas under lifted tinted surfaces and light themes the mirror image. Apps should paint their page canvas with `--background`.
- Inverted tint (opt-in): `tint.mode` set to `foreground` keeps backgrounds exactly as themed and moves the tint into the `--foreground`/`--muted-foreground` tokens themselves, re-blended per theme from new `--base-*` token copies served by the stylesheet.
- WebGL surface effects (opt-in): the `webgl` option in `blade-components.php` renders the surface tint as a live glow — drifting blobs of the tint colour composited behind the content of elements tagged `data-bc-webgl="<component>"` (Card, Header and Sidebar opt in). `webgl.components` toggles each component key, `webgl.intensity` scales the glow and `webgl.max_dpr` caps render resolution. Browsers without a WebGL context, elements off-screen and users with `prefers-reduced-motion` silently keep the CSS tint.
